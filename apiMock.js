            "description": "Dragon silicone mold - &#39;Baby Dragon&#39; by FPC Sugarcraft. \n\nA cute baby dragon, taken from our original hand sculpted wax model. Great for Game of Thrones and other Fantasy themed cakes.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you our high quality silicone moulds for sugarcraft cake decorations and other craft projects. Low cost worldwide shipping, with free delivery in the UK. \n\nFPC Sugarcraft is a family run business producing sugarcraft moulds, based in Bristol, UK. The majority of our designs are hand sculpted by us in wax relief, with a few designs derived from found items, so hopefully you will not find our designs anywhere else - beware of imitations!\n\nWe are pleased to offer you our range of unique high quality silicone moulds, for cupcake and celebration cake decorations and many kinds of craft projects. All of our moulds are designed and manufactured in-house from soft, flexible platinum-cured silicone, ideally suited for moulding sugarpaste decorations. \n\nOther foodstuffs and other modelling materials may be used in our moulds, including wax, soap, Fimo/Sculpey and PMC. The silicone material can withstand relatively high temperatures for short periods (up to 250ºC/480ºF) and possesses inherently good release properties, making demoulding trouble free.\n\nAn indication of the product size in shown in all of our product images. The background grid shows squares 1cm x 1cm (approximately 0.4in x 0.4in). Please note that whilst every care is taken to ensure the accuracy of scale in these images, all dimensions should be considered for guidance only.\n\nThe moulds are shown with examples of finished, painted sugarpaste impressions that can be made using them. The coloured impressions are for illustration purposes only and are not included in the offer of sale.",

Will Champion joined as drummer and backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band. The band renamed themselves \"Coldplay\" in 1998, before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers & Sisters and The Blue Room in 1999. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single \"Yellow\" in 2000, followed in the same year by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won awards including NME's Album of the Year. Their next release, X&Y, the bestselling album worldwide in 2005, received mostly positive reviews, though some critics felt it was inferior to its predecessor. Their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released to largely positive reviews, earning several Grammy Award nominations and wins at the 51st Grammy Awards. In October 2011, Coldplay released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which topped the charts in over 34 countries and was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011, but received mixed reviews, In May 2014, they released their sixth album, Ghost Stories, which also received mixed reviews and topped the iTunes Store albums charts in over 100 countries.

After briefly using the name Polar Bear and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's sound grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music, yet has maintained an anthemic sound built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's effects-based guitar textures. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.The band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, Boy (1980). Subsequent work such as their first UK number-one album, War (1983), and the singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. The group's fifth album, The Joshua Tree (1987), made them international superstars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US, \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\". Facing a backlash and creative stagnation, U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991), and the multimedia intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band integrated influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 is the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history. The group's thirteenth album, Songs of Innocence (2014), was released at no cost through the iTunes Store, but received criticism for its automatic placement in users' music libraries.", "wUrl": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2_(music)", "yUrl": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XmSdTa9kaiQ", "yID": "XmSdTa9kaiQ" }, { "Name": "The Fray", "Type": "music", "wTeaser": "The Fray is an American rock band from Denver, Colorado.
